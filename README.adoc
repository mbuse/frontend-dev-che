= CoreMedia Frontend Workspace for Blueprints

This README file describes how you get started with the CoreMedia Frontend Workspace for Blueprints.

toc::[]


Developing Themes and Bricks works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

== Build with pnpm

Building directly on your workstation provides you with a immediate integration with your IDE and
is the preferred way for all frontend developers.

=== Prerequisites
* Node.js `[18.x,)`
* pnpm `[8.6.x,)`

=== Build the Themes

From the workspace root folder run the following commands, to install all dependencies and build the themes:

[source,sh]
----
pnpm install
pnpm build
----

Create a new theme and run the built-in command for developer mode. It will will automatically reload the browser if you make changes to the code.

[source,sh]
----
pnpm create-theme <name>
pnpm install
cd themes/<name>-theme
pnpm start
----

You can run tests via `pnpm test`.

For further instructions consult the _``Frontend Developer Guide``_.

== Build with Docker

The frontend workspace can also be build using Docker to encapsulate all the installation requirements of the build environment in a container. Using the provided `Dockerfile.tasks`, you can easily build a CI/CD process using either the Theme Importer application to import the created `frontend.zip`.

=== Prerequistes

* Docker `[v19.03,)`
* https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/[Buildkit] enabled

Please add the following to your `.npmrc`

..npmrc
----
# https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/1069
unsafe-perm=true
----

=== Build the Themes

To build and test the frontend workspace just execute

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf target && mkdir -p target
docker buildx build -o target --secret id=npmrc,src=${NPM_RC_PATH:-~/.npmrc} -f Dockerfile.tasks .
----

The resulting `frontend.zip` can be found in the `target` folder.

=== Code Completion for FreeMarker Templates

Code completion for FreeMarker templates only works out-of-the-box when using the _``CoreMedia Blueprint Workspace``_. In
addition to this you need to enable the Maven profile `code-completion` in your IDE.

=== Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error message like

----
Error response from daemon: Dockerfile parse error line xxx: Unknown flag: mount
----

You need to prefix your `docker build` call with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build`.
